## Introduction

Random forests or random decision forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set. In our case Random Forest produced a score of around 0.994 and was the best model.

## Setup

Run the webchecker.py file. This will launch a webpage on the localhost server, where one can upload files to check whether they're malicious or not.

You don't need to run the machine learning file again since the .pkl file is already included here.
